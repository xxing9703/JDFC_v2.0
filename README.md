# JDFC_v2.0
 This is a rewritten and simplified code based on version JDFC_v1.1 from https://github.com/stefanbroeer/JDFC_v1.1
 
 Here's the associated paper: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-25563-x from Stefan Broer's group.
 
 The main code is reduced from 1700 lines to 120 lines, by removing redundant variables and hard-coded & repeated codes.
 
 The input files are reformated into a single file: "input.xlsx" with multiple tabs.
 
 The Computational speed is ~50X faster.
 
 JDFC_v2.0 is tested to fully reproduce the results from JDFC_v1.1, and is reusable and extendable with more flexibilities.
